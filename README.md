# Wander
Wander is a modern & responsive  Landing page for a fictional travel tour company designed and developed by me. 

# Features
Created a design system and architected scalable styling with the BEM naming methodology and 5/1 SCSS file structure. There is also some javascript in the mix, which was used to make the image slider functional and a few CSS animations to bring the page to life.
